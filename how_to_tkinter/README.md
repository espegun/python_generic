[Grid manager tutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-grid/)  

* The intersection of a row and column is called a *cell*. Every cell can only contain one *widget*, but this could be a *Frame*, which could have sub-widgets.
* The height of a row and width of a column depends on highest and widest widget in it, respectively.
* Using `rowspan` or `columnspan` > 1, cells can span more than one row/column.
