## OOP in general

Classes are about:
* Data - Data wich are all part of the same entity
* Actions - The methods which can do operations on those data

The main benefits between
* Reduce the number of couplings across the code, related data and methods gathered in classes.

## Encapsulation
* Data in objects should not be directly accessible, only through methods - because.....

## Inhertiance
* Makes it easier to reuse code for related classes.
* The inherited class (baseclass) can be seen as the inner core of of the inheriting class (subclass).


*Composition over Inheritance?*

## Polymorphism
